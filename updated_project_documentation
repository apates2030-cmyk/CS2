1. Updated Project Documentation

Feature Updates:
• Adds tasks to a list with user input
• Displays all current tasks with numbering
• Marks tasks as complete and removes them from the list
• Input validation for menu selection (1–4)

File/Function Structure:
• add_task() – adds a new task to the list
• view_tasks() – shows all tasks with numbering
• complete_task() – removes a task by its number
• main() – handles menu, user input, and program flow

New Technologies / Tools:
• Python 3 – for coding the task manager
• GitHub – version control and repository management
• Markdown – for README file documentation

2. Detailed Methodology

Core Features Implementation:
• add_task() appends the user-inputted task to the tasks list
• view_tasks() enumerates and prints each task with a number
• complete_task() removes the selected task after validating its index
• main() loops the menu, processes choices, and validates input

Technologies Used & Justification:
• Python: simple, readable, and easy to run locally
• GitHub: tracks changes and allows version control
• Markdown/README: explains project installation, usage, and features

Backend–Frontend Communication:
• Not applicable – the project is console-based

Design Decisions / Trade-offs:
• Console interface chosen for simplicity
• Modular functions improve readability and maintainability
• Prioritized ease of use over advanced features

Ethical Considerations:
• User privacy: program runs locally, does not store personal data
• Accessibility: numbered menu and clear prompts
• Intellectual property: all references cited, no uncredited code used

3. Annotated GitHub Repository

Organization:
• Python file in root directory
• Documentation file (this Word document) included in root directory
• README.md provides instructions and overview

Commit Practices:
• Descriptive commits, e.g.,
• “Added add_task, view_tasks, complete_task functions”
• “Implemented menu input validation and main loop”

Branch Usage:
• Main branch used for all development
• Optional feature branches may be used for experiments

README Updates:
• Includes project description, installation instructions, usage, features, and progress

4. Programming and Computing Ethics Reflection
• Respect for intellectual property: all references cited
• User privacy: no data is collected or stored
• Accessibility: clear, readable prompts and output
• Open-source code credit: ACM Code of Ethics followed
